## Editing guide

### Site info

To edit site info such as site title and description, edit the `src/site.config.ts` file.

### Page contents

To edit the resume homepage content and design, edit the `src/pages/index.astro` file.

### Page components

To edit page components found site-wide such as the card used in the homepage, edit the files found in the `src/components/` directory.

### Layouts

To edit the base layouts of all pages, edit the `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` file.

## Theming

To change the theme colours of the site, edit the `src/styles/app.css` file.

To change the fonts of the site, add your font files into `/public`, add it as a `@font-face` in the `src/styles/app.css` file, as a `fontFamily` in the `tailwind.config.js` file, and apply the new font class to the `body` tag in the `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` file.
